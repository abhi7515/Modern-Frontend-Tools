React Context is one of the most misunderstood features in modern React.
Too many teams treat it as a replacement for global state management — and pay the price in performance and complexity.

Let's clear this up 👇

🔎 𝐖𝐡𝐚𝐭 𝐂𝐨𝐧𝐭𝐞𝐱𝐭 𝐑𝐞𝐚𝐥𝐥𝐲 𝐈𝐬
Context is best for sharing static or rarely changing values across a tree:
✅ Theme settings
✅ User authentication info
✅ Localization/language
It helps avoid prop drilling for deeply nested components.

⚠️ 𝐓𝐡𝐞 𝐏𝐞𝐫𝐟𝐨𝐫𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐜𝐞 𝐓𝐫𝐚𝐩
Context updates re-render every consumer.
If you store large, frequently-changing state in Context:
- Unnecessary re-renders happen everywhere
- Components re-render even if they don't use changed data
- Your app slows down as it grows

For data that changes often, consider:
🔹 Local component state (useState / useReducer)
🔹 Libraries designed for global state, like Zustand, Redux, Jotai
These tools can manage subscriptions at a granular level without rerendering your whole app.

✅ Use it for static/shared config
✅ Avoid putting dynamic, high-frequency state in Context
✅ Pick the right tool for your state’s shape and needs
