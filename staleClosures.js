🧠 setTimeout with useState
When you use setTimeout(() => ..., delay), you're scheduling a function to run in the future — after the current render cycle finishes.

So:

useEffect(() => {
  const timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setState(newValue);
  }, 1000);

  return () => clearTimeout(timer);
}, [dependency]);



✅ The Right Way: Use Functional Update

setState(prev => nextValueBasedOn(prev));

setTimeout(() => {
  setCurrentIndex((prevIndex) =>
    prevIndex === trafficConfig.length - 1 ? 0 : prevIndex + 1
  );
}, trafficConfig[currentIndex].duration);


Why?

It ensures you always use the latest value of state — no matter when the timeout runs.

You don’t rely on currentIndex from when setTimeout was created, which could be outdated.


setTimeout(() => {
  setCurrentIndex(currentIndex + 1); // ❌ currentIndex might be stale
}, trafficConfig[currentIndex].duration);



so when a timeout is created just like a lexical environment is passed along with it with existing values and scheduled to be run later, but the lexical values also change due to other values parts of code, so when makeing modification inside useState always use current existin g value as reference and return if passing () => { return xyz}
