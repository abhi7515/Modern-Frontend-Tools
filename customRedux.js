 Second Round:
🌐 Concentrated on frontend development.
🔍 Asked questions about React, components, optimization, and how the web works.
🔄 Explored the differences between a React app and a normal app.
🔧 Lots of questions about Redux, including its architecture, sagas, and thunks.
💡 Finally, I was given a question to implement a custom Redux store. Managed to solve it with some help from the interviewer 😂. He was very helpful and patient. 🙏

prepare me for this
